"""Deterministically generates the tiny synthetic dataset under .tests/,
used by config/test.yaml for a fast end-to-end smoke test of the workflow
(mirrors nf-core's `-profile test` pattern).

Not part of the workflow DAG -- run manually if you ever need to
regenerate/resize the test data:

    python3 .tests/generate_test_data.py

Layout produced:
    .tests/resources/genome.fa           one 50kb contig "chrT"
    .tests/resources/genome.gtf          100 genes, "chrT" 1001-31000 (+)
    .tests/resources/te_annotation.gtf   one TE,   "chrT" 40001-46000 (+)
    .tests/reads/{sample}_R{1,2}.fastq.gz            paired-end samples
    .tests/reads/{sample}_R1.fastq.gz                single-end samples
    .tests/reads/treatment_rep1_L{001,002}_R{1,2}.fastq.gz   (paired-end, lane-split)
    .tests/reads/control_rep3_L{001,002}_R1.fastq.gz         (single-end, lane-split)
    .tests/samples.csv

Single-end samples (control_rep3, treatment_rep3) deliberately sit in the
same two conditions as the paired-end samples so the test run exercises the
workflow's per-sample single/paired-end branching -- trimming (trim_galore
vs trim_galore_se), STAR --readFilesIn, RSeQC strandedness auto-detection
(which supports single-end BAMs), and the chimera screen's per-sample
junction parsing. Every sample also carries a small number of SPLIT READS
(gene segment + TE segment in one read, see CHIMERA_READS) so STAR emits
real gene-TE chimeric junctions and the chimera annotation / counts /
sample-QC stages run on non-empty data instead of silently passing on
zero-event inputs.

Genome size note: earlier versions of this script used a 10kb genome, which
turned out to sit in STAR's known small-genome crash zone (custom
references under ~10-20kb can trigger "double free or corruption" while
writing the SAindex, even with --genomeSAindexNbases correctly downscaled --
see e.g. alexdobin/STAR issues #2158, #965, #1472, #350). 50kb plus an
explicit --genomeChrBinNbits override (config/test.yaml) avoids that.

DESeq2 sizing note: the count design matters. A contrast with a handful of
genes whose per-gene dispersions all sit near the minimum makes DESeq2's
mean-dispersion curve fit throw ("all gene-wise dispersion estimates are
within 2 orders of magnitude from the minimum value"). So the synthetic data
uses (a) 100 genes, (b) base expression spread log-uniformly over 2..500
counts, and (c) within-group (between-replicate) multipliers of 0.5x/1.5x
(and 1.0x/3.0x for treatment, which is 2x control on average). That spread
keeps the gene-wise dispersion estimates spanning well over 2 orders of
magnitude, which is what DESeq2's fit requires -- verified empirically.
